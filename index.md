### **Data Analyst | Computer Science Graduate**

My passion lies in applying analytical expertise to build a sustainable future. I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of the Witwatersrand and a Data Analytics graduate at ALX, passionate about turning data into insights that solve real-world problems and support strategic
 decision-making. I bring a solid foundation in programming, leveraging a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and PowerBI to drive process optimization and strategic decision-making, along with a curious, analytical mindset. I enjoy uncovering patterns in data, making sense of complexity, and communicating findings in clear, meaningful ways. My interest in analytics and machine learning is matched by my initiative, collaborative spirit, and love for learning. I am excited to contribute to purpose-driven, innovative teams where I can grow and create sustainable impact.
